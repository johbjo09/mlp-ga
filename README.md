# Multi-Layer perceptrons train with Genetic Algorithms

## Dependencies
Numpy and matplotlib should be the only dependencies for running these.

## Contents

mlp.py
------
An implementation for a multi-layer perceptron and back-propagation.

ga.py
-----
A generalized implementation for genetic algorithms.

mlp_test.py
-----------
Tests of logic functions and gauss functions using back-propagation.

test_ga.py
----------
Tests of the logic functions and gauss using genetic algorithms.

## Running
To show live how a MLP is used to approximate gaussian surface using GA, run:
```
python test_ga
```
The console print outs describe the progress of the genetic algorithm.

There is an equivalent test using back-propagation:
```
python mlp_test
```
